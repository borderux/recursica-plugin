# Release Workflow
# This workflow handles the release process for the Recursica Figma plugin.
#
# Process:
# 1. Triggered by pushing a version tag (e.g., v0.0.8)
# 2. Updates package.json version to match the tag
# 3. Builds the plugin and creates a zip file
# 4. Uploads the zip as a GitHub Actions artifact
#
# The workflow will automatically:
# - Update version in package.json from the tag
# - Install dependencies
# - Build the plugin
# - Create a zip file in the release/ directory
# - Upload the zip as an artifact named 'recursica-plugin.zip'
#
# Artifacts:
# - The built plugin zip file will be available in the GitHub Actions run summary
# - Artifacts are retained for 30 days
# - Location: release/recursica-plugin.zip
